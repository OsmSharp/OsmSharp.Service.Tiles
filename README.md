OsmSharp.Service.Tiles
======================

WARNING: this is not anywhere near a real-live planet-wide tile server. Use this just for fun!

Serves tiles directly from raw OSM files using the rendering functionality of OsmSharp. This makes awesome things possible like: (OSM-PBF or OSM-XML) + MapCSS = Tiles in Leaflet!
